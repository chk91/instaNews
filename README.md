# InstaNews Project

### Summary
For the Instanews project, I used the New York Times API to retrieve top stories in different categories. Through this project, I have learned how to use aJax to incorporate api into my site. The gulp tool was a pain while setting up, but it became very handy by the time everything was set up. 

### Language and Tools
HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript jQuery Gulp SCSS heapBox(for the dropdown menu).
